In this project, we aim to develop a system that can recognize and detect various poses involved in Surya Namaskar, a popular sequence of yoga postures known for its numerous health benefits. The system will utilize computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze live or recorded video feeds of individuals performing Surya Namaskar. The primary objectives of the project include:

Pose Recognition: Implementing algorithms to accurately recognize each pose within the Surya Namaskar sequence in real-time or from recorded videos.

Pose Detection: Developing methods to detect the correct alignment and execution of each pose, providing feedback on posture and technique.

Feedback and Correction: Integrating a feedback mechanism that can provide real-time feedback to users about their pose accuracy, alignment, and overall performance.

Smart Healthcare Integration: Designing the system to be integrated with smart healthcare platforms, allowing users to track their progress over time, set goals, and receive personalized recommendations based on their performance data.

User Interface: Developing a user-friendly interface that displays real-time feedback and analysis, making it accessible for both individuals practicing yoga at home and professionals monitoring multiple users in a clinical setting.

Scalability and Adaptability: Ensuring the system is scalable to accommodate varying levels of expertise and adaptable to different environments and camera setups.

Expected Outcomes:

Improved accessibility to yoga practice and personalized health monitoring through technology.
Enhanced user engagement and motivation by providing immediate feedback and progress tracking.
Contribution to smart healthcare innovations by integrating yoga and wellness monitoring into digital health platforms.

Overall, the Surya Namaskar pose recognition and detection project represents a significant step towards leveraging technology for enhancing personal health practices and contributing to smart healthcare solutions.
